# Upgrade notes — team layer

Changes that need an action, or a second look, in a project that already runs the team layer.
Newest first.

## Permission classes are off until the profile enables them

**Before:** every deterministic class (`merge-line`, `allow-offline`, `add-ask`, `prod-diagnose`)
was **on** unless the Operator switched it off. `prod-diagnose` existed as soon as its `dir` and
`privileged` were set.

**Now:** a class is active only when `.claude/project-profile.json → teams.policy.classes.<name>.enabled`
is exactly `true` **and** its runtime switch is not off. `team_prompt_classes.py switches <main>`
prints `disabled` for a class the profile does not enable.

**Action:** if your TeamLead relied on a class, enable it in the profile:

```json
"teams": { "policy": { "classes": {
  "merge_line":    {"enabled": true},
  "allow_offline": {"enabled": true},
  "add_ask":       {"enabled": true},
  "prod_diagnose": {"enabled": true, "dir": "scripts/ops/", "privileged": "<regex>"}
} } }
```

What you will see otherwise: ask-tier prompts that used to be answered at tier 1 become Operator actions (`class <name> not enabled`), and the auto-merge gate refuses a PR that adds offline allow entries.

## Protocol headings are English

The headings one file writes and another reads are now fixed English. Prose under them follows the profile's `language` (`pl` | `en`). A run whose wrapup was written before the upgrade keeps the old headings. Read them with this map:

| Old (Polish) | New |
|---|---|
| `## Planowanie` | `## Planning` |
| `## Co ważne dla Ciebie` | `## What matters for you` |
| `## Decyzje nadzorcy` | `## Supervisor decisions` |
| `## Pamięć odłożona (B)` | `## Deferred memory (B)` |
| „Decyzje TeamLead” (READY note section) | "TeamLead decisions" |
| `Decyzje nadzorcy: <n> …` (READY count line) | the same line, in the developer's language |
| `Mergować <team>?` | `Merge <team>?` |
| `Advisor bez odpowiedzi (<reason>)` | `Advisor no reply (<reason>)` |
| dashboard `czeka na odpowiedź` | `waiting for an answer` |

The Operator's words are English (`approve`, `reject`, `answer`, `revoke`). The Polish forms (`zatwierdź`, `odrzuć`, `odpowiedz`, `cofnij`) stay accepted as aliases.
